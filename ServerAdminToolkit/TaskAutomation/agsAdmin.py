'''
This script makes use of the same functions as found in the Code/AllFunctions.py samples.
It has been enhanced with more error trapping and uses command line arguments to run.
The script can be run as a python script:
C:\myScripts>c:\python27\python.exe agsAdmin.py myServer 6080 admin admin list

It has also been used to create a stand alone executable (.exe) which you can use on a system without python.
Call the .exe in the same way you would call the python script (without the call to python.exe first)
C:\myScripts>agsAdmin.exe myServer 6080 admin admin list

If you make modifications to the script and want to re-build the .exe, install py2eye module, and execute it against the 
setup.py file (included): C:\myScripts>c:\python27\python.exe setup.py py2exe

These scripts provided as samples and are not supported through Esri Technical Support.
Please direct questions to either the Python user forum : http://forums.arcgis.com/forums/117-Python
or the ArcGIS Server General : http://forums.arcgis.com/forums/8-ArcGIS-Server-General
